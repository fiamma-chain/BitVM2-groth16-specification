It needs more opcodes if we implement the double or add operator in $G_1$ directly because there are some divison operators which
is not bitcoin-friendly. We obey the rules proposed in paper On Proving pairing.


\subsubsection{Double}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Show that the pair ($\lambda$, $\mu$), indeed define a tangent through $T$ showing that $\displaystyle y_1 - \lambda x_{1} - mu = 0$ 
    and $\displaystyle 2\lambda y_1 = 3x_1^2$. This step is dominated by $2\tilde{m}$ and one $\tilde{s}$
    \item Compute $\lambda^2$ which is simple one $\tilde{s}$
    \item Compute $\displaystyle x_3 = \lambda^2-2x_1$ and $\displaystyle 2\lambda y_3 = -\mu - \lambda x_3$ which is dominated by computing $\lambda x_3$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Add}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Show that the pair ($\lambda$, $\mu$), indeed define a tangent through $T$ showing that $\displaystyle y_1 - \lambda x_{1} - mu = 0$ 
    and $\displaystyle y_2 - \lambda x_{2} - mu = 0$. This step is dominated by $2\tilde{m}$
    \item Compute $\lambda^2$ which is simple one $\tilde{s}$
    \item Compute $\displaystyle x_3 = \lambda^2-x_1-x_2$ and $\displaystyle 2\lambda y_3 = -\mu - \lambda x_3$ which is dominated by computing $\lambda x_3$
\end{itemize}
