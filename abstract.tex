    In this paper, we present our methodology for implementing Groth16 verification within the Bitcoin framework, utilizing the BitVM2 repository. We extend our gratitude to contributors such as Robin, Lukas, Weikeng, and the Zerosync team for their invaluable contributions to this project. The objectives of this paper are threefold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Peer Review: We invite the BitVM2 community to review our design and implementation, providing feedback to enhance its robustness and efficiency.
    \item Knowledge Dissemination: We aim to provide a detailed exposition on the integration of BitVM2 with Groth16 to enlighten further developers and researchers about its operational mechanics.
    \item Community Collaboration: By sharing our findings, we seek to catalyze collaborative development efforts within the community to expedite the safe production readiness of BitVM2.

\end{itemize}

    Through this publication, we hope to contribute significantly to the evolution and adoption of BitVM2, fostering a safer and more efficient deployment in production environments.
