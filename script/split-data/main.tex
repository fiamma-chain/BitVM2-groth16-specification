\subsection{Split data} \label{sec:split-data}

We present the results directly on how we split the script whose size exceeds the 4M limitation, as demonstrated in \ref{sec:benchmark-data},
there are only some operations of $F_{q12}$ that need to be split after we optimize the operations for $G_1$ and $G_2$.

We will demonstrate how we manually split these four large scripts one by one, striving to satisfy the following properties concurrently:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensuring that size and stack depth limitations are not exceeded;
    \item Minimizing the size of inputs and outputs;
    \item Making the logic of each chunk as clear and readable as possible; 
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
    operator type & script size & max depth & exceed 4M? \\ \hline
    $F_{q12}: a * b$ & \textcolor{red}{11,641,775} bytes & 545 & yes \\ \hline
    $F_{q12}: frobenius\_map(1)$ & \textcolor{red}{4,541,887} bytes & - & yes \\ \hline
    $F_{q12}: mul\_by\_034$ & \textcolor{red}{9,810,459} bytes & - & yes \\ \hline
    $F_{q12}: ell\_by\_constant$ & \textcolor{red}{9,525,050} bytes & 383 & yes \\ \hline    
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
