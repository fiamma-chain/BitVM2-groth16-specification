\subsection{Split data} \label{sec:split-data}

We give the result directly how we split the script which the size exceeds the 4M limitation. As we showed in the \ref{sec:bench-data},

There only have some operations of $F_{q12}$ need to be split after we optimize the operations for $G_1$ and $G_2$

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
    operator typr & script size & max depth & exceed 4M? \\ \hline
    $F_{q12}: a * b$ & \textcolor{red}{11,641,775} bytes & 545 & yes \\ \hline
    $F_{q12}: frobenius\_map(1)$ & \textcolor{red}{4,541,887} bytes & - & yes \\ \hline
    $F_{q12}: mul\_by\_034$ & \textcolor{red}{9,810,459} bytes & - & yes \\ \hline
    $F_{q12}: ell\_by\_constant$ & \textcolor{red}{9,525,050} bytes & 383 & yes \\ \hline    
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


We will show how we split these 4 big script one by one, as we split it manually, we try our best to satifying the following property cocurrently:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Doesn't exceed the limitation of size and stack depth;
    \item Keeping the size of input and output is minimal;
    \item Try our best to make logic of each chunk is readable; 
\end{itemize}
