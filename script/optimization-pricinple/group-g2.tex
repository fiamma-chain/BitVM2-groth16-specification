\subsection{group-g2}

The unique difference between $G_1$ and $G_2$ is that $G_1$ is based on $F_q$ while $G_2$ is based on $F_{q2}$.

Based on this optimization, we reduce the size of Double and Add operator largely. So we dont need to split the Double and 
Add operations now. This is a big improvement.

Additionally, we also highly reduce the size of Double and Add operators in $G_1$ as well. Now, we can combine at most 3 randome operators
into one script chunk while before optimization, we only could combine 2 Double operators into 1 script chunk and only 1 Add operator for 1
script chunk. It reduce the number of script chunks for MSM part to around 1/3 directly.
