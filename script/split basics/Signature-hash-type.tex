\subsubsection{Signature hash type}

A SIGNHASH \cite{website:signhash} flag is used to indicate which part of the transaction is signed. 
The mechanism provides a flexibility in constructing transactions. 
There are in total 6 different flag combinations that can be added to a digital signature in a transaction. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item 0x01 = SIGHASH\_ALL : Sign all inputs and outputs
    \item 0x02 = SIGHASH\_NONE : Sign all inputs and no output
    \item 0x03 = SIGHASH\_SINGLE : Sign all inputs and the output with the same index
    \item 0x81 = SIGHASH\_ANYONECANPAY | SIGHASH\_ALL : Sign its own input and all outputs
    \item 0x82 = SIGHASH\_ANYONECANPAY | SIGHASH\_NONE : Sign its own input and no output
    \item 0x83 = SIGHASH\_ANYONECANPAY | SIGHASH\_SINGLE : Sign its own input and the output with the same index
\end{itemize}
