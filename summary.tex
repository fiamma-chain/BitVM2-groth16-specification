\section{Next Steps}

Stay tuned for implementation details on Fflonk \cite{website:Fflonk} in the BitVM2 framework. Fflonk is the ZK algorithm adopted by Polygon CDK \cite{website:Polygon-CDK}.

Some current key metrics of our implementation of Fflonk are in the followings: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Script size: 1.512292967 G
    \item Sub script numbers: 890
    \item Average script size: 1.699205 M
\end{itemize}
