\subsection{Limitations-on-bitcoin-script}

There are some constraints we have to take into account:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Max script size: 4MB;
    \item Max stack depth: 1000 (main stack + alt stack);
    \item Max stack item size: 520 bytes
    \item 1 bit signature size: 26 bytes with Winternitz;
\end{itemize}

As the signature is much big now, so we plan to use economic games to reduce the risk of being malicious in our first version.
We wil give clarification on this later.
