\section{Automated Slashing} \label{sec:automated-slashing}

As a PoS chain powered by Babylon, Fiamma adheres to two critical security properties outlined in the Babylon litepaper \cite{website:litepaper}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fully Slashable PoS Security}: In the event of a safety violation, the Bitcoin stake is guaranteed to be slashed.
    \item \textbf{Staker Security}: Each Bitcoin staker can withdraw or unbond their funds as long as they adhere to the PoS protocol honestly.
\end{itemize}

Fiamma is a ZKP verification chain utilizing BitVM2. A key functionality of BitVM2 is to enable slashing, thus fulfilling the first property. While the main focus of this paper is not on the second property, we provide an alternative method to ensure compliance with this property as well. Further details will be provided separately.
